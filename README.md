This is the final project of ISD at FIT HANU. 

In this project, we develop a customer relationship management system for Infinity Group to manage customer information and update work status. Our team has one PM, one BA, one tester, and two developers. 

I play the role of BA, in charge of collecting user requirements and providing solutions based on the harmony between the team's capacity and the customer's needs.

Due to the limited time of the course, the system was created to meet the most basic needs of a CRM website.

As a BA, I made the following files:
- Project Description - overview of the project
- Sprint Plan & Sprint Backlog & Product Backlog - including 16 basic functions of the website, divided into three sprints according to the Agile process and labeled with the corresponding person in charge
- Minutes of meeting - recording the minutes of meetings with customers and internal team meetings
- Testcases - check and write basic testcases
